# AstraBot: Autonomous Aerial Swarm Coordination

## Overview
AstraBot is a decentralized control algorithm designed for autonomous aerial drones. Using reinforcement learning (RL) and multi-agent systems, AstraBot allows drone swarms to achieve robust formation and collision-free path planning in dynamic environments. This framework simulates real-world disaster rescue missions, allowing drones to navigate effectively in challenging conditions.

## Features
- **Decentralized Control Algorithm**: Utilizes RL for decentralized coordination of drones in a swarm.
- **Collision-Free Path Planning**: Ensures that drones in the swarm avoid collisions and maintain a coordinated formation.
- **Disaster Rescue Simulations**: Simulates drone behavior in dynamic environments to replicate real-world disaster scenarios.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Gym
- Stable-Baselines3
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AstraBot.git
cd AstraBot
pip install -r requirements.txt
